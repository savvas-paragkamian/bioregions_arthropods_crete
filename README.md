# Bioregionalisation of Crete based on arthropds

Using the most complete and curated dataset of the Cretan arthropds here we investigate:

* the bioregions of Crete using the infomap algorithm
* the drivers of bioregions and the differences of endemics with non-endemics
* what is the role of elevation? is there any more resolute proxy to explain the differences
* glmms
